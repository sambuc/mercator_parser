//! # Mercator Parser
//!
//! Query parser for Mercator.
//!
//! ## Mercator: Spatial Index
//!
//! **Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the
//! [Human Brain Project]. It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph]
//! service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata
//! registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.
//!
//! It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.
//!
//! ## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit
//! **Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be
//! combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.
//!
//! Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific
//! physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the
//! developer to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by
//! the specific indices provided.
//!
//! This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the
//! underlying data structure, and re-used.
